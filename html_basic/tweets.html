	  <p> Gender equality is not just about women's rights, it is about recognizing that gender is a social construct that affects everyone.<br>
		  It is about creating a society where individuals are not limited by their gender and are able to achieve their full potential, regardless of their identity. <br>
		  Achieving gender equality requires breaking down gender stereotypes and creating systems that promote inclusivity and diversity. <br>
		  It is only by working together and acknowledging the interconnectedness of our struggles that we can create a more equitable and just world for all.</p>
